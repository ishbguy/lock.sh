                   " If I should die and leave you here awhile,
                     Be not like others, sore undone who keep
                     Long vigils by the silent dust, and weep.
                     For my sake - turn again to life and smile,
                     Nerving thy heart and trembling hand to do
                     Something to comfort other hearts than thine.
                     Complete those dear unfinished tasks of mine
                     And I, perchance, may therein comfort you."
